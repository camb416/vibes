# User Story
1. User opens page and sees a grey square
2. A camera does a dolly zoom in on a metallic object in the frame. The camera settles in position.
3. The object in frame slowly rotates in place
4. The user clicks and drags on the view to rotate the object manually.

# Functional Notes
- The view should be a 3D context using A-Frame
- Rotation and navigation should work with mouse and touch input
- The view should be locked to 1280x720
- The view should have a little gear button to show a visual inspector
- The view should be centered horizontally and vertically in the page

# Visual Notes
- The spinning object should look like an endless curve, a cool mobius strip with some subtle variation in texture on the surface
- The object should have a rose-gold appearance
- The view should have a grey backdrop with a studio HDRI for lighting
- It should look really high-fidelity, and be optimized for high-end mobile devices, tablets and laptops
