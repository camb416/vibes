- first attempt looks good, but don't see anything
- after several prompts, i diagnosed that the canvas was rendering 0x0
- it fixed this, and would even import a model, but the paint function didn't work, despite the instructions screen saying left mouse was paint
- i protested, and it made left click "paint", and right click "move", with on screen instructions. This made left click stop moving the camera, but IT DOESN'T PAINT ANYTHING.
- None of the functions in the UI actually do anything. I'm giving up for now.
