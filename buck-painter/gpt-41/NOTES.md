- GPT 4.1 actually asked me some questions before it started, which made me feel seen.
- It's actually using vite and some tooling. Cool.
- GPT keeps stopping, but it's made a little to-do list for itself. This is really good
- you need to babysit it, but it moves pretty slow and doesn't seem to break things outright nearly as much as Claude
- making changes or improvements to existing features does kind of jump the line and get in the way of the to-dos though
