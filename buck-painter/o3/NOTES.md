- it made a "start painting button" I clicked it, nothing happens
- sent the typeerror back to o3
- it also didn't automatically give me the command to run a local http-server, but i know how to do that so whatever.
- do wish these things would think to make a livereload environment
- holy shit it kinda worked
- importing model doesn't work though.
