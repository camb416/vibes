1. User
I want to make an app that runs full bleed in a browser
The app should run at 60fps on a mid-range Macbook Pro with integrated graphics/Apple Silicon M1 Pro or better
The app will be operated by a skilled designer

2. Features
I want to be able to generate complex structured images from a small set of inputs
The inputs should be 
- typeface/font (selected form a short list of variable weight fonts)
- iterations
- type of algorithm

The system should generate a complex pattern or structure from a single letter, or sequence of letters.
It does not have to render in 1/60 of a second. It's okay if it takes up to 1s to generate
User should be able to export a raster of the image
The seed of the image should display and be usable as a permalink to regen the same image
Provide some simple controls, and on first load, automatically generate something.
Have an I'm Feeling Lucky Button to quickly generate something awesome.
It should have a STOP button to interrupt generating immediately 

3. Visual Style
It should be vaguely swiss in aesthetic
But Futuristic in the complexity of the fractal generation
Make it look crisp, but dont make the letters so small they're not discernable
Utilize color and tints with intention, maybe have color palettes to choose from (not a color picker, make it quicker with pre-selected palettes)
