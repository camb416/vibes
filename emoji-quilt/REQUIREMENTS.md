- fullscreen app
- minimal UI
- generate a 3D noise field and display emoji on a dynamic grid
- animate the grid over time (animate the Z prop of the noise)
- the shape of the grid should change a bit, and which emoji are in each cell should also evolve in an organic way.
- I'm feeling lucky button to get new grid/settings
