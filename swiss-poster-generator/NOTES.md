- Giving up on trying to get a browser-based design generation to export to anything. SVG sucks, Figma has a wack process, and ultimately fails and doesn't bring in the procedual elements... basically just displays the SVG.
- If i were to REALLY do this, it should be a Figma plugin.
- Make something closer to the actual design package.
