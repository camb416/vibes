1. User
  - Users will use a desktop or laptop computer with a recent browser. Target Chrome or similar
  - Users will load the page quickly, with minimal external dependencies

2. Developer Features
  - The app will hot-reload on changes
  - The app will have its styles, markup and scripts separated
  - No file will be longer than 500 lines

3. User Features
  - The user will load the page to start the app
  - a "reload" button on the page
  - a checkbox, which will toggle the grid view. This view should show the margins, padding, and all spacings between gridded design elements on each page.
  - a content dropdown, which contains text fields for each semantic element displayed in the pages.
  - by default, each poster has its own content, but when anything is entered in the fields below the content editor, the content is replaced with whats in those fields entered by the user.
  - The rest will be a large canvas displaying 64 different swiss poster designs. Display these in up to 8 cols wide.
  - The posters, in black and white, will feature Black, White and Red design elements
  - The posters will use greeked type
  - The posters will all feature random stock images, printed in black and white, with interesting crops and placements, considering whitespace appropriate to Swiss design principles
  - The content of the posters is irrelevant, but imagine they're designed for a jazz band in the 70s, or an architecture symposium.
  - Refresh the page to get new ones
  - rollover each one to present UI
  - UI should display "export" dropdown for SVG, figma or PNG download of each one.
  - Toggling the grid view will display thin red and blue lines indicating the margins, gutters and alignments of each of the posters.
  - The app should be able to generate virtually unlimited designs, with random unsplash images, and procedurally generated grids, that most importantly, all look pleasing to the eye.
  - they need a lot of variation.
  - Not every one should have a photo. Some of them should have type that breaks the grid in a pleasing way, some should have large type or graphic elements instead of photos
  - change what elements use red in each one
  - change the type sizes, but keep 'em pleasing.
  - make some of the options of graphic elements squares, rectangles, triangles, and super large and bold type that fill up in some cases, more than half the page
  - be crazy daring with the designs
  - when graphic elements stack on top of type, make sure the type is in front
  - clicking the Figma export should automatically open it in Figma, skip the downloading the JSON step
  - the posters should be either 8.5x11 aspect, or 17x11 double page spreads
  - sometimes make the background of the poster a color, and use reversed (white) type, or a tinted ground for the type
  - use variations on leading and tracking, subtly on body copy, and in the extreme on teh headlines for visual impact.
  - do NOT use drop shadows on type in the poster. Ever.
  - use a nice, slightly beige red. Don't make it #FF0000, it's too saturated.
  - don't be afraid to make the photo full bleed, and reverse all or some of the type out (white) and use a color field to make the body copy legible.
  - Add some additional info in small type in the margins or below the body copy (in visual weight). This could indicate dates, credits, copyright
  - you can use tints of any color
  - always make subhead, and smaller type units fit within the grid of the poster, and have the highest z-index. Make the body copy not get so big, and if the headline is so massive that it goes way off the page, repeat it in a visually legible color. And i repeat, NO DROP SHADOWS or GLOWS on type!

4. Visual Notes
  - Make the background slightly off-white, with blue grid lines, tightly packed.
  - Use gradients to make subtle shadows to make it look a little skeuomorphic, but subtle
  - Use only thin lines 1px gray to indicate page edges.
  - Don't animate the posters when you hover, nor change their dimensions.
  - Give each poster a subtle (SUBTLE) but evocative drop shadow.
  - Align the UI nicely in the grid with the posters
  - Title the RELOAD button "GENERATE"
