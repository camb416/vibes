# My Vibe Coding Guidelines

Vibe coding is bringing a lot of new folks into software development. This is great! I'm doing it lots too. I'm sharing my personal approach and philosophy on the practice in hopes that it fosters a healthy culture of creativity around generated software.

## 1. Respect the craft

I try not to say I "built" or "coded" these things. I try to use _generated_ or _prompted_. I wouldn't say I _painted_ an image that I got from ChatGPT.

## 2. Don't be impatient

Testing and iterating on software takes time, and makes it better. Fighting with LLMs because they're acting drunk and breaking unrelated things can also take a long time. 

## 3. Record human intentions

I try to record what I want to build in a REQUIREMENTS.md file and use it as my first prompt. If I don't like the vibes, I can always trash literally everything else and start over. The beauty of these is that they work for human developers as well as LLMs!

## 4. Keep it to a day

My vibe coding is most fun and effective for the first hour or two. If I'm spending more than a day on an idea, I'm probably either being inefficient, or not really vibe coding anymore.

## 5. Don't Trust it

If I'm not reading the code, I don't post it publicly.
